### Description 

**R** is a popular computer program for scientific data processing, analysis and visualization. It is open-source and free to use. 

To start learning and using advanced workflows in R efficiently, some core skills in R programming need to be learned. Investing time in the (boring) basics builds a solid foundation, from where it is easy to start constructing reproducible and shareable data analysis pipelines with high quality reports and graphics. 

On this introductory short-course we immerse ourselves with the R software environment and get comfortable with the very basics of R and R programming. The student learns enough of the basics to be able to start self-learning from online sources, and is able to participate in the follow-up seminar series "R for data science" on advanced data analysis techniques.

The course borrows ideas from the online-book ["Hands-on programming with R" by Garrett Grolemund](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) which can be skimmed as a preparation for the course. 

### Pre-requisites

* No previous experience in R is needed
* No previous experience in programming is needed
* Computer with recent versions of **R** and **Rstudio** successfully installed
  * On Valtti computers, install the latest versions from the Software Center
  * Make sure that Rstudio can be opened without any error dialogues
  <!-- * , and that in the "Console"-tab the text says that the version of R is at least 4.1 -->
* Know how to type on your keyboard all these brackets: `<angle>`, `{curly}`, `(round)`, and `[square]`

Programming is best learned by writing code, so try to mentally prepare for typing unfamiliar things very carefully. ðŸ¤–

### Learning objectives

After attending this course, the participants should be able to:

- Understand R syntax and write and execute simple R scripts
- Navigate Rstudio and find help in the documentation system
- Be aware of the package system and install add-on packages to R
    <!-- - Import and export csv using R -->
- Do basic data *wrangling* in R i.e. process data-tables for down-stream analysis
- Use basic graphics functionality to visualize data in R
  <!-- - Perform some basic statistical analysis in R -->
- Be able to study, on their own or by participating in Luke's upcoming online seminar series, the online book ["R for Data Science" (Hadley Wickham)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
